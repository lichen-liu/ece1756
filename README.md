## Lab2

### ModelSim
Open ModelSim
```
modelsim18.start &
```
Simulate
```
cd <path to lab2.sv> # Navigate to the directory containing your designâ€™s Verilog files
vlib work # Create a library called work in which your results will be placed
vlog lab2.sv # Compile lab1.sv
vlog lab2_tb.sv # Compile the testbench
vsim work.lab2_tb # Starts the simulator, with a top-level module of the lab1 testbench
view wave # Open the waveform window
run -all # Run simulation to completion which is OK because the testbench applies a fixed number of
     inputs and then issues a $stop command
```
